1. How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users
a. Data Theft
Steal login credentials, cookies, or session tokens.
Capture sensitive form data like passwords or credit card numbers.

Redirect users to phishing or fraudulent pages.
Replace search results with links to unsafe or sponsored content.

c. Browser Hijacking

e. Cryptojacking

f. Surveillance and Tracking

Build behavioral profiles for advertising or criminal use.
Sell collected data to third parties.

g. Disabling Security
